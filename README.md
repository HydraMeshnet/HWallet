# ĦWallet

The world's first & only blackout-resilient cryptocurrency wallet, that can run in an energy-autonomous radio meshnet. The ĦWallet will soon offer Blackout-Resilience as a Service (BRaaS) (with our ĦMESH utility coin as fee) for other blockchain ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD-stablecoins, ERC20 token, etc. in order to make these cryptocurrencies usable in crisis areas with power outages for the first time. The ĦWallet already hosts the Presale of our HMESH ERC20 token and the ĦShop for our hardware products. In the future it will also host the HMESH DEX, after being implemented on our own ĦMESH-L1.
